### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- Git - [Download here](https://git-scm.com/)

For git download, `$ git --version` will prompt you to download the latest version. 

Navigate to Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows), and enter the following commands.

1. **Clone and Navigate to this repo:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sxashwathr/ClearViz/
```
```bash
cd ClearViz
```
2. **Install Nodejs dependences:**
```bash
npm install
```
3. **Start the application locally:**
```bash
npm start

```
4. **Navigate to your main browser (ports may vary):**
```bash
http://localhost:3000
```
The application will automatically open in your default browser.

### Troubleshooting
- If you get permission errors, try `sudo npm install` (Mac/Linux) or run as administrator (Windows)
- If port 3000 is busy, the app will use the next available port (Note: you're port might not be 3000)
- Make sure Node.js is installed: `node --version`
